# Elastic SIEM Home Lab

This home lab project introduces a hands-on simulation of an enterprise-grade Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Elastic Stack and a Kali Linux VM. It demonstrates how security teams collect, analyze, and respond to events in real time. This project will use Elastic Cloud for the backend, configure Elastic Agent and Filebeat for log shipping, simulate malicious activity (e.g., port scans), and set up real-time alerts and dashboards.
